INDENTATION
===========

The editor indents based on the last token in the line. If it is something
that continues the current expression, it "tabs" to the beginning of the
current expression. If it isn't, it only tabs to the last position on the
"indentation stack."  The "del key" (or something like that) at the
beginning of the line deletes enough white spaces to go back to the next
"indentation stack" position.

REASONING: 
----------

A more Scheme-like form of indentation requires a full-fledged parsing of
terms as they are typed in, which is way too complicated. 

Also, beginners attempt to insert their own spacing and aren't bothered by
a lack of spacing the way we're bothered when Emacs doesn't go to the right
column after hitting return.
