INTERACTION
===========

The interaction editor always replies with an indented line to a first
carriage return. If the user hits <cr> again, it will attempt to evaluate
the expression in the current state. 

REASONING: 
----------

The scheme is consistent with the editor window.

Return is natural for line feed and a second return is acceptable for
starting evaluation.
